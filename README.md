## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My challenge was to build out this newsletter form and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


# Lessons Learned and takeaways

- Will revisit to set up form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
